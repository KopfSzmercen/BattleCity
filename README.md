# BattleCity

# Short description

Although this game was made for educational purpose and is not optimalized, I thought it'd be great to share it.
It's made in pure JS with addition of SCSS and HTML and based on a well known game Battle City (Tanks 1990).
To bundle everything I used Webpack.

# Construction

Well, there's not much to talk about as it is a simple game. 
To create a plan of the map I created a simple application in the folder EasyMapGenerator. 
In it you can click on a cell if you want it to be a brick. When you're done you can save and download your plan in a form of JSON file.
The downside of it is that you have to paste this file to the folder with maps and rebuild project... Maybe I'll try to work it out in the future.

You can controll your golden tank using arrows and you shoot using the space bar.
